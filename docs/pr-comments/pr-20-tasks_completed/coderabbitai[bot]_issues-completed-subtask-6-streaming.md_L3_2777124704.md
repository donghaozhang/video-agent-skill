_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Clarify completion status.**

The status is marked as COMPLETED (line 3), but line 15 explicitly mentions remaining work for CLI integration. Consider updating the status to reflect the partial completion (e.g., "COMPLETED (core module)" or "IN PROGRESS") or remove the remaining work note if it has since been completed.
Also applies to: 15-15
