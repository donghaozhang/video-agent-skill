_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Clarify the completion status.**

The status is marked as "COMPLETED" on line 3, but line 14 lists "**Remaining work**" that includes wiring CLI flags and integration. This creates confusion about whether the implementation is actually finished.

If the work is complete, remove or update the "Remaining work" note. If there's still work pending, update the status accordingly.
